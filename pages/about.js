              <p>
                I am a UI/UX designer with a creative and passionate background in creating
                user-centric and engaging digital products. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in
                Electronics and Communication engineering and a creative portfolio of projects
                demonstrating my user research, wireframing, prototyping, testing, and UI design
                skills. I am proficient in using tools such as Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD. I am
                eager to learn from experienced UX/UI professionals and contribute to the design
                process with my creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving abilities.
