                I am a UI/UX designer with a creative and passionate background in creating
                user-centric and engaging digital products. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in
                Electronics and Communication engineering and a creative portfolio of projects
                demonstrating my user research, wireframing, prototyping, testing, and UI design
                skills. I am proficient in using tools such as Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD. I am
                eager to learn from experienced UX/UI professionals and contribute to the design
                process with my creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving abilities.

              <p>One of the high points in my photography career was when <strong><a href="https://www.omanmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Oman Magazine</a></strong> published my photographs during my tour of the country. I played my visual strengths of capturing people in their moment, the native farmers of Oman in the deserts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salalah" target="_blank">Salalah</a> with their livestock and the pictures came out really well.
