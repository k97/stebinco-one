> As a UX Designer at Newmont's Lihir Gold mining operations, I led the research and implementation of the ReadiWatch system—a wearable technology solution designed to monitor and prevent fatigue-related incidents among mining personnel.

#### The Challenge

Fatigue had been identified as the root cause of several Significant Potential Events (SPEs) at the mining site. Operators working long shifts in demanding conditions were particularly vulnerable to fatigue-related incidents, posing serious safety risks and impacting operational efficiency.

**Key Issues:**
- Multiple fatigue-related incidents affecting safety
- No proactive monitoring system in place
- High-risk roles (haul truck operators, bus drivers) particularly vulnerable
- Traditional fatigue management methods were reactive rather than preventative

#### My Role

As a UX Designer supporting the lead designer in this project, I was part of a two-person design team responsible for:

- Supporting comprehensive user research initiatives
- Conducting diary studies to understand miners' daily workflows and sleep patterns
- Synthesising research findings into actionable insights
- Contributing to the user experience design for the ReadiWatch system
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams including site managers, safety officers, and IT specialists

#### Research Methodology

##### Diary Studies

I implemented a diary study program where miners documented their:
- Sleep patterns and quality
- Daily routines and activities
- Fatigue levels throughout shifts
- Environmental factors affecting rest

This research method provided valuable insights into the natural sleep-wake cycles during shift work and highlighted how camp accommodation impacted sleep quality.

##### Stakeholder Interviews

I conducted in-depth interviews with various stakeholders:
- Mining department heads
- Site safety managers
- Equipment operators
- Health and safety representatives

These interviews allowed me to understand different perspectives on fatigue management and identify specific user needs across various roles.

#### Key Research Findings

The research phase revealed several critical insights:

1. **Sleep Pattern Analysis**
   - Operators working night shifts showed highly irregular sleep patterns
   - Camp accommodation factors significantly impacted sleep quality
   - Environmental conditions (noise, temperature, light) affected rest periods

2. **Operational Impact**
   - Fatigue-related incidents peaked during specific shift times
   - Traditional observation-based methods were inconsistent and subjective
   - Operators needed real-time awareness of their fatigue levels

## Solution Design

Based on our research findings, our two-person design team collaborated to create a comprehensive fatigue management system centred around the ReadiWatch wearable device.

##### Core Features

1. **24/7 Sleep Monitoring**: Waterproof wristband tracking sleep patterns with automatic data syncing through strategically placed stations across the mining site.

2. **Proactive Alert System**: Real-time ReadiScore calculations alerting supervisors when operators fall below safe fatigue thresholds before shifts begin.

3. **Data Integration**: Seamless connection with existing CAT Driver Safety System providing supervisors with unified fatigue monitoring through a centralised dashboard.

#### Design Strategy

Our design team developed a phased design & implementation approach:

1. **Pilot Phase**: Targeted rollout with 50 haul truck operators, including personalised training sessions and weekly feedback collection.

2. **Extended Rollout**: Expansion to 200 bus operators and light vehicle drivers with standardised onboarding and daily monitoring.

3. **Full Deployment**: Complete implementation across 500 safety-critical positions with integrated health assessments and automated compliance tracking.

#### Results and Impact

The implementation of the ReadiWatch system delivered exceptional results:

- **90% reduction** in overall fatigue events
- **72% reduction** in microsleep incidents over 14 months with the initial CAT DSS system
- **62% additional reduction** after ReadiWatch implementation
- **80% decrease** in fatigue-related incidents among haul truck operators

Beyond the quantitative metrics, the project delivered significant qualitative improvements:

##### Safety Improvements
- Proactive fatigue management system
- Real-time monitoring and intervention
- Enhanced safety culture across the organisation

##### Operational Efficiency
- Reduced downtime from fatigue-related incidents
- Improved resource allocation
- Enhanced productivity through better-rested operators

##### Cultural Impact
- Increased awareness of fatigue management
- Improved worker engagement in safety practices
- Enhanced trust between operators and management

#### Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable insights that have informed my approach to UX research and design:

1. **User-Centred Design is Critical**
   - Early operator involvement led to higher adoption rates
   - Regular feedback loops improved feature implementation
   - Understanding workplace culture was crucial for success

2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**
   - Regular analysis of sleep patterns informed policy changes
   - Quantitative metrics helped demonstrate ROI
   - Continuous monitoring enabled system refinement

3. **Change Management**
   - Clear communication was essential for adoption
   - Training and support systems were crucial
   - Regular stakeholder engagement maintained momentum

#### Conclusion

The ReadiWatch implementation demonstrates how human-centred design and technology can transform safety practices in high-risk industries. By focusing on user needs and implementing a comprehensive solution, we achieved significant improvements in safety metrics while enhancing operational efficiency.

This project showcases my ability to:
- Lead complex research initiatives
- Translate user insights into practical solutions
- Implement technology solutions in challenging environments
- Drive meaningful change in safety-critical operations
