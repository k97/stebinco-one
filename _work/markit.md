> An unsolicited design project to simplify marketplace transactions and help elevate endusers to reduce the carbon print by reusing products within the community.

### Objective

While using Facebook marketplace I was searching if there is a standalone marketplace app which will be just for market place purpose and decided to do research and conducted a survey on people who are using marketplace and the pain points associated in it and tried to address it by using various techniques such as personas, crazy 8, storyboards and prototyping before moving to the design part.

### Problem/Oppurtunity

From conducting survey we were able to get the users response from 4 different regions around the world and synthesis it to a report.
Buyer/seller non-responsiveness on these platforms
Product listing issues
Most number of people use Facebook marketplace for listing and purchasing
Request to new features such as payments, search, planning tools amongst other features

### Hypothesis

Ideate, prototype and design a separate a marketplace mobile app.

#### Defining personas (optional)

Created 3 different personas based on the survey report.

### Process

- Screen flows
- Moodboard
- Typography
- Colours
- Screens prototyping (paper)
- Other UX methods: flow charts, form survey design, crazy 8, storyboarding (pictures, artefacts etc) - presentable format
  Survey stratergy
- Persona
- Crazy 8
- Journey mapping

### Final outcome

Quick brief - 50 to 100 words: about the project, lessons learnt, and any future improvements.
The project started as a separate marketplace app in mind has turned out to be a well researched, ideated, and iterated app now. The main eye opener was the power of surrey and addressing it on a customer journey map scenario with personas in place which helped me understand the empathy part of the design thinking which I personally think is the first step towards the solution.
