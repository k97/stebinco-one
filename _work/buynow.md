> An unsolicited design project to implement 1-Click checkout into The Iconic ecommerce portal, so customer problems are identified and addressed, leading to increased business efficiency.

![](/work/theiconic/slide1.jpg)

### Objective

1-Click checkout process was first invented by the e-commerce giant Amazon.com. This process happens when customers visit their online shopping cart and purchase items with a single click. Customers only need to fill in their information once. This also eliminates the clunky experience of navigating to a separate payment screen and manually entering personal information. So I expanded on this hypothesis to one of Australia’s e-commerce giants, TheIconic as an unsolicited design & research project.

### Problem/Opportunity

While I did some desk research, the following came up as top pain points in the current conventional checkout process.

- The current product checkout process is lengthy with more steps
- Product fulfilment takes more time until an entire order is completed
- Cart items tend to elapse during high-demand sales promotional seasons

### Hypothesis

Making 1-click checkout a more accessible option for customers to checkout products on The Iconic than the conventional checkout, which typically involves several steps, including adding items to the cart, inputting shipping and billing information, reviewing the order, and finally, submitting payment. This process is often seen as time-consuming and can be frustrating for customers, particularly if they have to navigate through multiple pages to complete their purchase. 1-Click Checkout simplifies the conventional checkout process, allowing customers to complete their purchases with a single click. Once a customer saves their contact, shipping and payment information, they can complete future purchases with a single click without having to re-enter their details. I had to look into the below pointers and look at potentially increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases.

- Convenience
- Security
- User Experience
- Cart Abandonment

#### User jobs

Purchase a product now as an existing & new customer of The Iconic e-commerce fashion platform.

- “Buy now” as an option to be apparent and straightforward to discover
- Prioritise and store customer data
- Remember to “buy now” preferences for future checkouts

### Design Process

I visualised the design process (refer to the below image), by how I progressed this feature implementation. The steps were sometimes nonlinear but at a high level this gave me an idea to move towards the next step when I had enough data to progress.

I also created screen flows to study how Amazon's checkout processes work for both the conventional & 1-Click checkouts worked. I used the ScreenFlow data later to map out and iterate the user flow for the Iconic portal.

I inherited The Iconic's brand design from here and started to prototype the screens in low fidelity to map out different hypotheses. Each hypothesis had its own strengths and tradeoffs. I tested these hypotheses with a small pool of volunteers and friends. I used the insights from these usability tests to expand on the solution and design the high-fidelity screens.

### Final outcome

During the research and testing process, my hypothesis about 1-Click Checkout was validated and I also discovered that it is essential to ensure the security of the process. Building on trust with the customers is essential in rolling out this feature which may not be apparent with just the user experience and enhancements. I also learnt to approach a feature design with more research processes and testing the hypothesis helped me gather more insights and vet any biases towards the preconceived screen designs.
