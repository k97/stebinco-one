> An unsolicited design project to implement a 1-click checkout feature for The Iconic ecommerce portal, so customer problems are identified & addressed, leading to increased business efficiency.

### Objective

I worked on an unsolicited design project to implement a 1-click checkout feature on The Iconic, so customer problems are identified & addressed, leading to increased business efficiency. 1-click checkout was invented by the e-commerce giant Amazon.com. This feature when implemented by Amazon during the last few years has made purchase decisions for customers to be easy and helpful. So I expanded on this hypothesis to one of Australia’s e-commerce giants, TheIconic.

### Problem/Oppurtunity

While I did some desk research, the following came up as top pain points for the customer of

- The current product checkout process is lengthy with more steps
- Product fulfilment takes more time until an entire order is completed and sometimes during the sale season elapses oncart
- Cart items tend to elapse during high-demand sales promotional seasons

### Hypothesis

Making 1-click checkout an easier option for customers to checkout products on The Iconic.

- Makes process easier
- Reduces purchase time
- Reduce confusion

### Solution

User jobs:
Buy a product now as an existing & new customer of The Iconic e-commerce fashion platform.

- “Buy now” as an option to be apparent and easy to discover
- Prioritise and store customer data
- Remember to “buy now” preferences for future checkouts

### Final outcome

Quick brief - 50 to 100 words: about the project, lessons learnt, and any future improvements.
The project which was started on a self interest has come out well with market research, hypothesis on the solution and design. While doing the research I came to know about the patency of the feature Buy now which was invented by Aamazon in 1999 and came out of it in 2017 and free to use for business by other firms. I also learned about screenflows, flowchart and then designing various hypothesis. While designing one should not take assumptions and while doing so how much accessibility and other issues can arrive was being self taught.
