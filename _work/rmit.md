> A travel app design project to simplify travel planning and flight booking, done as part of the RMIT University course.

### Objective

The Airborne Airlines project was the last part of the RMIT UI/UX design course I have enrolled in 2021 and I was assigned to choose from 3 projects and I chose to create a mobile airlines app using Figma. The main intention of the app was to create a flight booking app which will allow users to book flights. Once completed I did a video recorded presentation on Loom.

### Problem/Oppurtunity

There are many apps in the market which have many options which look very complicated at times and RMIT wanted students to design a very simple and user friendly design for flight booking

### Hypothesis

The RMIT projects main objective was to create simple flight booking app using Figma.
With the help of flowcharts, moodboards and setting typographies I was able to approach the design on paper and then take it to Figma.Through low, mid and high fidelity I have created mobile app for flight booking.

### Process

#### Research

Before starting the design or ideate process for my current app I wanted to know the competitor application design

#### Flow chart

I started with flowchart on user flow on a flight booking app which helped to eliminate the assumption part.

#### Low -Fi on paper

For the low fidelity I chose the paper prototyping for the ease of idea flow and to see how much details I can gather from iterations. I tried to stick onto the basics by doing some desk research on the existing websites such as Booking.com and flight center.

#### Mid-Fi on paper

From Low fidelity design I jumped onto mid fidelity on the paper again to go on with a bit more descriptive iteration which will help in high fidelity and tried to define the buttons placement and the

### Design Process

#### Moodboard

Before stepping onto the High fidelity design I tried to search around for my moodboard inspirations and the vague idea which developed in my mind during the paper prototyping started to take shape and I was able see which images might help me decide on the theme, colors and design.

#### Typography

I listed my fonts used in my design with the size and font names for maintaining uniformity throughout my design process.

#### Colours

The colors used in the design was listed along with hexa code
Screen flows - High Fidelity
As the mid fidelity design was made on the paper I was ready to take my design to the Figma and paper iteration came into help with which I was able to define what I can design and not much confusions on the field/button/image placements.

### Final outcome

RMIT course has given me a good insight into design thinking and how to design a mobile app using the Figma app. Being a first timer I was able to follow the instructions and present my prototype via video recording and pass the project.
