> ReactGPT.ai is an engineering-focused solution for front-end engineers to boost their coding workflow with specialised React AI. As a design consultant, I am working along with stakeholders of project leaders & engineers remotely across Australia. This project is currently a work in progress, and I intend to update this portfolio entry as I progress with my deliverables.

#### Objective

ReactGPT aims to solve the problem of inefficiency in React development workflows by leveraging AI to provide intelligent code suggestions, debugging assistance, and component optimization recommendations specifically tailored for React developers.

#### Design Process

I am using several qualitative and quantitative methods to conduct the research. After spending time on desk research to frame the hypothesis around improving developer productivity with AI assistance, I am gathering insights through evaluative research methods. This involves researching the latest trends in the AI industry, mapping out potential user personas, and conducting competitive analysis of similar products in the market.

#### Research

<!-- ![Research process illustration] -->

Who: The users of ReactGPT are going to be primarily front-end developers working with React
What: To streamline and enhance React development workflow through AI assistance
When: During coding sessions, debugging, and component development
Why: To improve productivity, reduce development time, and enhance code quality

#### Problem framing

ReactGPT is addressing several key pain points that React developers face:
- Time-consuming debugging processes
- Repetitive boilerplate code writing
- Difficulty in optimizing component performance
- Challenges in keeping up with React best practices and updates

With the help of my colleagues, I have set up an ideation panel to generate some ideas. To help facilitate the session, I am mapping the user journey of React developers during their typical workflow. I have introduced the participants to the research and helped emphasize the user problems, with personas and storyboarding making this process easier.

#### Prototyping

With several ideas to tackle the current problem set, I am prototyping the solution. I find this to be non-linear since it allows me to frame the HMW (How Might We) questions while starting to prototype the screens. I am sketching out several iterations of wireframes and mockups to design a functional workflow that encompasses landing pages and the onboarding process that involves sign-up and login.

This approach is saving a lot of time to test some of the new ideas and make improvements before designing high-fidelity screens.

#### Current Progress

So far, I have produced designs for:
- Landing pages that clearly communicate ReactGPT's value proposition
- Onboarding flows for new users, including sign-up and login processes
- Initial dashboard layouts for returning users

I am synthesizing research insights to create a comprehensive understanding of user needs and expectations. This involves mapping out the developer journey and identifying key touchpoints where AI assistance would be most valuable.

The project is evolving as I continue to gather feedback from stakeholders and potential users. I am iterating on the designs based on this feedback to ensure that the final product will meet the needs of React developers effectively.

#### Next Steps

As this project progresses, I will be focusing on:
- Completing high-fidelity mockups for the entire user flow
- Conducting usability testing with React developers
- Refining the interface based on user feedback
- Exploring additional features and enhancements based on research findings

Stay tuned for updates as this project evolves and more deliverables are completed.
