  aboutContent: [
    "I'm Stebin Sebastine, a UI/UX designer in Melbourne, Australia. I've always been passionate about finding creative approaches to solve problems, which is why I started enjoying UX design very much. I find it incredibly satisfying to create digital experiences that are both creative and enjoyable to use, and I believe that good design can have a positive impact on people's lives.",
    "Before moving to Australia, I lived in Dubai, UAE where I was born. I spent most of my life working towards getting into a creative field and so I started dabbling with 3D modelling and animation before endeavouring into photography. I started working as a Sales Consultant and then turned into a CX Analyst while practising photography, Still, all along I found the application of creative solutions to technology fascinating. Amidst migrating to Australia and starting a small family, I also enrolled on a design course at RMIT University and managed to get started with User Interface and Experience design, since then I have kept myself busy with freelance and unsolicited projects. I found that my background in CX and Sales has enabled me to be more receptive to customer perspectives and approach design with a bit more empathy while solving problems.",
    "When I'm not designing, I enjoy photography as another creative outlet. I have curated some of my clicks <a href='/photography'>here</a>. I'm also an amateur guitarist and I wind down to play some music from time to time."
